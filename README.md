# WHRI
iPad application developed for World Hunger Relief International to streamline the transaction process and allow for a greater customization of data analysis.  
  
**index.php** is the webpage on which the items are presented in JSON format, for the application to access. These items are then shown within the application to the individuals involved in checking out customers, and are updated seasonally, so the lists are up to date.  
  
**whri.sql** is the exported database of the structured data, including several example data points.
